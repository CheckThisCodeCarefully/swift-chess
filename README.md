A simple chess game built from scratch for OSX, entirely using Swift 2.0.

#### Running the project
All that should be needed to build this is an up-to-date version of Xcode, on any suitable OSX environment. As soon as a suitable release build is pushed, this will contain a link to an associated GitHub release.

#### Features
* OSX-native Cocoa GUI
* Human vs Human gameplay
* "Special" chess move support:
  * Castling
  * Queening
  * En Passant's rule
* Multiple icon sets, thanks to [PyChess](https://github.com/pychess/pychess) (licensing info in [LICENSING.md](https://github.com/JackBCousineau/swift-chess/blob/master/LICENSING.md))


#### Planned features
* Full code documentation (in-progress, see most recent commit)
* LAN network multiplayer [in-progress](https://github.com/JackBCousineau/swift-chess/commit/00755a2825a53ec688e2b5618a2901b81ae54cbe)
