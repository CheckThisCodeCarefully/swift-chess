A simple chess game built from scratch for OSX, entirely using Swift 2.0.

#### Features
* OSX-native Cocoa GUI
* Human vs Human gameplay
* "Special" chess move support:
  * Castling
  * Queening
  * En Passant's rule
 * Multiple icon sets, thanks to [PyChess](https://github.com/pychess/pychess) (licensing info in [LICENSING.md](https://github.com/JackBCousineau/swift-chess/blob/master/LICENSING.md))


#### Planned features
* King checking detection
